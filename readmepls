gatito os v3.0
a 32-bit x86 operating system kernel written in assembly
overview
gatito os is a minimal operating system that boots directly into protected mode and provides a graphical user interface with multiple applications. it runs on x86 architecture and uses vga mode 13h (320x200, 256 colors) for graphics.

applications
notepad - text editor with basic editing features

keyboard shortcuts: ctrl+a (select all), ctrl+c (copy), ctrl+v (paste), ctrl+s (save)
cursor navigation with arrow keys

terminal - command line interface

available commands:

help - show available commands
clear - clear screen
info - system information
ls - list files
echo <text> - print text
dralar install <package> - install package
run <app> - run application
power <mode> - power management (gelado/desempenho/status)
module load/unload/list - module management
taskmgr - open task manager



file explorer - browse and manage files

navigate with arrow keys
press enter to open file
press 'd' to delete file
press 'n' to create new file
supports up to 64 files

image viewer - display images and screenshots

press 'p' to set current image as wallpaper
can view screenshots taken with f12

paint - simple drawing application

7 color palette (red, green, yellow, blue, dark red, black, cyan)
draw with spacebar
move cursor with arrow keys
press 'c' to clear canvas
available only after installing paint package

task manager - system monitor

displays cpu frequency
memory usage statistics
process count
package and module information
auto-refresh mode (toggle with 'a')
manual refresh with 'r'

package system (dralar)
install additional functionality:

paint - drawing application
network - network module (tcp/ip)

usage: dralar install <package_name>
module system
loadable modules for extended functionality:

viewer - image viewer (loaded by default)
taskmgr - task manager

usage:

module load <module_name>
module unload <module_name>
module list

power management
three power modes:

normal - balanced performance
gelado - extreme power saving (low cpu frequency, high loop delay)
desempenho - maximum performance (high cpu frequency, minimal loop delay)

usage: power <gelado/desempenho/status>
keyboard shortcuts
global

f12 - take screenshot
win key - open/close start menu
esc - return to desktop
n - open notepad (from desktop)
t - open terminal (from desktop)
e - open file explorer (from desktop)
v - open image viewer (from desktop)

clipboard

ctrl+a - select all
ctrl+c - copy
ctrl+v - paste
ctrl+s - save file (notepad)

navigation

arrow keys - navigate/move cursor
enter - confirm/execute
space - draw pixel (paint) / space character (text editors)

memory layout
0x10000  - kernel code start
0x20000  - image load address
0x30000  - screenshot buffer
0x40000  - filesystem base
0x50000  - vram backup
0x60000  - package base
0x70000  - module base
0x80000  - heap pointer start
0x90000  - stack pointer

filesystem

max files: 64
filename length: 12 characters
file content: 256 bytes
total entry size: 268 bytes

graphics

resolution: 320x200 pixels
color depth: 8-bit (256 colors)
vga mode: 13h
custom 8x8 bitmap font

interrupts

keyboard: irq 1 (int 0x21)
mouse: irq 12 (int 0x2c)
pic remapped to 0x20-0x27 and 0x28-0x2f

building and running
this kernel expects to be loaded at address 0x10000 in protected mode. you'll need:

an x86 assembler (nasm recommended)
a bootloader to load the kernel
qemu or real hardware for testing

assemble with: nasm -f bin kernel.asm -o kernel.bin

default files
the system comes with these pre-created files:

readme.txt - welcome message
hello.txt - hello world message
system.ini - system version info
notes.txt - package information
info.txt - package manager info

limitations

no multitasking
no network stack (network module is placeholder)
simple filesystem with no persistence
fixed 320x200 resolution
limited to 64 files
no dynamic memory allocation
text buffer sizes are fixed

architecture
the kernel uses a modular design with separate handlers for:

graphics primitives (pixels, rectangles, fonts)
input devices (keyboard, mouse)
applications (notepad, terminal, etc)
system services (clipboard, screenshots, file management)
power management (cpu frequency scaling)

notes

all text is in portuguese (brazilian)
color scheme uses vga palette
mouse cursor is drawn as a simple triangle
screenshots are stored in memory only
wallpaper feature loads from image buffer
